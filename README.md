# Water level controller
Hello, The development of a water level meter was carried out as a final project; giving solution to a problem presented in large companies, which requires control over the water tanks implemented within their facilities. In the first place, three different sensors are taken into account, which provide information on when a high, medium or low level is reached inside the tank; For this reason, the use of PIC16f15244 is implemented to program the project code, giving a solution to the problem. On the other hand, the assembly is carried out to verify the proper functioning of the code.

# Elements required for its operation.
the elements that were used for the realization of this project were:
-PIC16F15244
-3 LEDs that were used as an output to alert where the water level is
-3 jumpers that were used as sensors

## Method of use
simply connect the jumpers to vtg in order to appreciate the different stages carried out that are shown in each led, you can be seen in the video added to the repository.
## Results
After so many hours of programming, you can get your water level controller, which with a good sensor, you can program it perfectly with your pic, and it will give you all the results, and stages or cycles that were used in this project.
